    "description": "# API Overview\n\nOur REST based API provides a lot of endpoints to communicate directly with our back end. These are the same endpoints\nwhich our front end uses.\n\nNearly all of our endpoints require authentication. You can make authenticated requests against the Control Panel API by\nproviding an Authorization token within the headers of your requests or with a cookie. We differentiate between\n\"login tokens\" and \"API access tokens\":\n\n- **login token**: Obtained by authenticating via the Control Panel. For example with credentials or by using M365 / other SSO providers.\n- **API access token**: Obtained by creating an API token for (admin) users within the Control Panel user setting interface.\n\nIf you perform authenticated requests against the Control Panel API by using \"API access tokens\", you are good to go. \nBut if you perform authenticated requests using a \"login token\" or unauthenticated ones, you **have to provide** an App-ID with\nyour request. This approach is explained further below.\n\n\n## Using the API\n\nIn general the communication with the Control Panel API is done by transmitting and receiving JSON. An example request\nusing cURL using the most basic endpoint looks like this:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s --request GET --url \"https://cp.hornetsecurity.com/api/v0/version/\"\n```\n```\n\"6.32.8.14\"\n```\n\n\n## Making authenticated API calls\n\nAs described above you have to provide a token within your request headers or via cookie to communicate with endpoints\nrequiring authentication. The provided token authenticates and identifies the user sending requests to the API. \n\nEvery action within the Control Panel is initiated by a requesting user and performed on a selected object. The selected\nobject refers to our hierarchy of users, customers or partners. Many endpoints are limited to a specific hierarchy\nlevel, but some of them might be capable of working with different object types.\n\nA request is authenticated  by adding the `Authorization` header:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Token <token>\n```\n\nIf the Authorization header is present in the request, it is preferred to the `auth_token` cookie.\n\n\n### Using API access tokens\n\nYou can obtain an API access token via the user settings view from within the Control Panel. There you can create new\naccess tokens for the currently logged in user. These tokens can have an optional expiry date. If not set, they won't\nexpire until deleted.\n\nAssuming that you have such an API access token, authenticated requests will work exactly like described in the example\nabove, by providing it via the Authorization header within your request.\n\nExample using an obtained API access token to make authenticated API requests:\n\n```bash\ncurl --request GET --url 'https://cp.hornetsecurity.com/api/v0/user/' \\\n     --header 'Authorization: Token 217c386123d1d1751638d0f60857394467fe395f'\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": 14685,\n  \"name\": \"user@example.com\",\n  \"path\": \"example.com/user@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n### Using login tokens\n\nYou can obtain a login token by successfully authenticating within the Control Panel. This token can then be used to\nmake further requests. If the user can authenticate using plain \"username / password\" credentials, you can call the\n[login](#operation/login_post) API endpoint with these credentials to obtain a valid login token for the given user\nidentified by the username.\n\nThe API call returns a response containing the authorization token. It also sets a cookie named `auth_token` with the\nvalid token as value.\n\n**Please note:** This is only possible if no other authentication back end is configured for the given user such as M365,\nan external IDP or LDAP auth.\n\n```bash\ncurl --request POST --url 'https://cp.hornetsecurity.com/api/v0/auth/login/' \\\n     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n     --data '{ \"username\": <username>, \"password\": <password> }'\n```\n```json\n{\"object_id\": 801745291, \"token\": \"217c386123d1d1751638d0f60857394467fe395f\"}\n```\n\nUsing login tokens for authenticated requests instead of API access tokens requires an additional header, called `App-ID`.\n\nThis App-ID is required to provide context to the application which uses personalized login tokens. This might be\nutilized to provide custom rate limits to specific applications or endpoints.\n\nYou can obtain such an App-ID by contacting our support. Treat the App-ID as a secret. It is not required if you use\nAPI access tokens as explained above.\n\nExample using an obtained login token in combination with a valid App-ID to make authenticated API requests:\n\n```bash\ncurl --request GET --url 'https://cp.hornetsecurity.com/api/v0/user/' \\\n     --header 'App-ID: <app_id>' \\\n     --header 'Authorization: Token 217c386123d1d1751638d0f60857394467fe395f'\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": 14685,\n  \"name\": \"user@example.com\",\n  \"path\": \"example.com/user@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n\n### Disclaimer\n\n**We will block applications or API access tokens temporarily or permanently if they don't use our API respectfully or\nabuse it under any means.** \n\n\n## Getting info about an object\n\nTo request information about an object, you must provide the object_id or the name to be able to identify the object. Then, the response will contain the data of the object.\n\n```bash\ncurl --request GET --url 'http://cp.hornetsecurity.com/api/v0/object/?object_id=123' \\\n     --header 'App-ID: <app_id>' \\\n     --header 'Authorization: Token 217c386123d1d1751638d0f60857394467fe395f' \n```\n```json\n{\"object_id\": 138, \"name\": \"gevonne.com\"}\n```\n\n```bash\ncurl --request GET --url 'http://cp.hornetsecurity.com/api/v0/object/?name=gevonne.com' \\\n     --header 'App-ID: <app_id>' \\\n     --header 'Authorization: Token 217c386123d1d1751638d0f60857394467fe395f'\n```\n```json\n{\"object_id\": 138, \"name\": \"gevonne.com\"}\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v0.12.0 (Auto Remediate)\n- Deprecated `GET /api/v0/thirdparty/o365/expostdeletion_permission_link/` in favor of `POST /api/v0/thirdparty/o365/autoremediate_permission_link/`\n\n### v0.11.1 (SMIME certificate update)\n\n- regarding SMIME certificate settings available via `POST /api/v0/email_encryption/smime_user_certificates/`\n  - in the payload the fields `firstname` and `lastname` have been deprecated and will not be processed anymore\n  - in the response\n    - the fields `year`, `domain` and `domain_fqdn` have been deprecated\n    - the fields `locked` and `cert_activationdate` have been added\n\n### v.0.11.0 (API credentials)\n- Remove the need of the `CP-Token` and `App-Version` headers\n- Only require the `App-Id` header if the request is authenticated by a login token.

      "description": "\n Endpoints for bulk operations (insert, update, delete) on users. Together these operations can be used to\n synchronise users of a customer from an external source.\n\n The synchronise process should always start with a bulk delete operation. After the delete operation has finished\n the bulk insert and update operations can be executed. The execution order of the insert and update operations\n doesn't matter.\n\n ### Request Structure\n The request bodies of the bulk operations are structured in a similar fashion.\n The request object contains a field `data` which contains key-value pairs of customer name and the customer\n request properties.\n\n Here is an example request for an insert or update operation:\n\n ``` json\n {\n     \"data\": {\n         \"testcustomer.de\": {\n             \"users\": [\n                 {\n                     \"emails\": [\n                         \"user1@testcustomer.de\",\n                         \"alias1@testcustomer.de\"\n                     ],\n                     \"groups\": [\"Bobsleighing\"]\n                     \"environment\": \"environmentname\"\n                     \"forename\": \"Bob\",\n                     \"surname\": \"Bobson\",\n                     \"city\": \"Example Town\",\n                     \"office\": \"Bobsleigh garage\",\n                     \"homepage\": \"bobsleighing.example.com\"\n                 },\n                 {\n                     \"emails\": [\n                         \"user2@testcustomer.de\",\n                         \"alias2@testcustomer.de\"\n                     ]\n                 }\n             ]\n         },\n         \"othercustomer.com\": {...}\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n The `emails` field contains the list of of emails for a user. The first email in this list will be used as the\n primary email address of the user. The primary email address can be used to identify a user.\n\n There are also a lot of optional LDAP-related fields. Two importand ones are `forename` and `surname`, which are\n used by TFFF. All LDAP fields are ignored if SaD is activated.\n\n <details>\n <summary>Expand me for a list of all LDAP fields</summary>\n\n - `city`\n - `commonname`\n - `company`\n - `countrycode`\n - `department`\n - `description`\n - `displayname`\n - `email`\n - `employee`\n - `fax`\n - `forename`\n - `guid`\n - `homepage`\n - `homephone`\n - `imaddress`\n - `info`\n - `iptelephone`\n - `mobile`\n - `office`\n - `pager`\n - `postalcode`\n - `postofficebox`\n - `samaccountname`\n - `state`\n - `street`\n - `superior`\n - `surname`\n - `telephone`\n - `usnchanged`\n\n All string fields except for `employee` are limited to 255 characters.\n </details>\n\n\n `groups`, also optional, contains a list of group names. Currently only one group will be used. The used\n group is the first existing group the user can be assigned to.\n When calling:\n - `/create`\n   - an empty list, or a list not containing any valid group has no effect.\n - `/update`\n   - an empty list, or a list not containing any valid group, will remove the group assignment of the existing user.\n   - if the list contains the already assigned group at any position, no changes will be made.\n\n\n ### Responses and Errors\n The bulk operations should not fail because of one problem with one user/customer. Therefore the operations always\n return a 200 OK response. To detect any errors you have to inspect the returned JSON. The customer object can\n contain `failed` and `error` fields. The `failed` field indicates that the whole import for this customer has\n failed. The `errors` field contains problematic users.\n\n ``` json\n {\n     \"data\": {\n         \"testcustomer.de\": {\n             \"errors\": {\n                 \"user1@testcustomer.de\": \"ERROR_ENUM\"\n                 \"user2@testcustomer.de\": [{\"alias2@testcustomer.de\": \"ERROR_ENUM\"}]\n             }\n         },\n         \"othercustomer.com\": {\n             \"failed\": \"Failed to import customer.\"\n         },\n     }\n }\n ```\n\n The example response indicates the following problems: The import for `othercustomer.com` failed completely.\n The user user1@testcustomer.de couldn't be imported. The alias email address alias2@testcustome.de couldn't be\n imported, but the user user2@testcustomer.de was created.\n\n Error Messages (ERROR_ENUM)\n\n ```\n[DATA_INVALID : Passed data is invalid.]\n[FAILED_TO_IMPORT : Customer data couldn't updated or inserted.]\n[EMAIL_IS_NOT_VALID: Given E-Mail is not a valid E-Mail]\n[DOMAIN_IS_NOT_VALID: Given domain is not valid]\n[ALREADY_IN_USE: Given e-mail is already in use]\n[UNKOWN_ERROR: Unknown Error occurred]\n[USER_CREATION_FAILED: Mailbox couldn't created]\n[DUPLICATE: Duplicate E-Mail Address in JSON Data found]\n ```\n"
